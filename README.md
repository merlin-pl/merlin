# Merlin

<a href="http://miso.es/tools/merlin/ for further">Merlin</a> is an Eclipse plugin 
to build and analyse product lines of mde artefacts (meta-models, model transformations...). 
It extends <a href="http://www.featureide.com/">FeatureIDE</a>
to create feature models and build product lines of meta-models. 
It supports the creation and analysis of transformation product lines 
defined with the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/">Epsilon</a>
model management languages.

The source code of Merlin has dependencies with FeatureIDE 3.5.3
and Epsilon 1.5.1, which need to be installed separately.
